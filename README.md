## How it Works
Operating through JavaScript and jQuery, the script identifies the relevant filter elements and triggers simulated clicks to activate the "Any" option under "Sale Type".

#### Key Steps:

1. **Detection:** The script scans the Path of Exile Trade website for elements related to the "Sale Type" filter.

2. **Selection:** Then it automatically selects the "Any" option within the "Sale Type" dropdown.

#### Clear Button Functionality

Additionally, the script is designed to respond to the Clear button. Clicking on it triggers the automatic selection of the "Any" option. This ensures that whenever the user resets search filters, the "Sale Type" filter defaults back to the desired "Any" setting.

This automation simplifies the process for users, ensuring that the default filter option is consistently set to "Any" without manual intervention.

## Installation
1. **Install a Userscript Manager**: Use a browser extension like Tampermonkey.
2. **Install the Script**: Add the script to your userscript manager by clicking on the [Install Link](https://github.com/D4Enjoyer/poe-any-as-default/raw/main/poe-any-as-default.user.js) or in any other way that you prefer.

## Usage
Once the userscript is installed, visit the Path of Exile Trade website. The script will automatically set the default "Sale Type" to "Any" in the filtering options, regardless of whether the "Trade Filters" sub-menu is opened or closed.
