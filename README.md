## How it Works
Operating through JavaScript, the script identifies the relevant filter elements, triggers simulated clicks to activate the dropdown menu, and subsequently chooses the "Any" option.

#### Key Steps:

1. **Detection:** The script scans the Path of Exile Trade website for elements related to the "Sale Type" filter.
   
2. **Activation:** Upon locating the filter, it initiates simulated clicks to activate the dropdown menu.

3. **Selection:** After activation, the script automatically selects the "Any" option within the "Sale Type" dropdown.

This automation simplifies the process for users, ensuring that the default filter option is consistently set to "Any" without manual intervention.

## Installation
1. **Install a Userscript Manager**: Use a browser extension like Tampermonkey.
